## Project Overview
Predicting house prices is a common problem in the real estate industry. This repository aims to provide a solution specifically for predicting house prices in Delhi, India. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed a model that can estimate the prices of houses based on various factors such as size, number of rooms, number of balconies, number of bathrooms, and other relevant features.

The prediction model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical house prices and corresponding features in Delhi.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the prediction model was obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about house prices and various features of flats in Delhi, India. The features include the size of the flat, number of rooms, number of balconies, number of bathrooms, and other relevant factors that can affect the price of a house. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namantrisoliya/magicbricks-new-delhi-flat-prices).

To use the dataset, download it from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the repository's root directory.

## Setup
To use the prediction model and run it on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link mentioned in the Dataset section and place it in the repository's root directory.

## Usage
Once you have set up the repository and installed the dependencies, you can use the prediction model to estimate house prices in Delhi. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script that contains the prediction model code.
2. Run the code to train the model on the provided dataset.
3. After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Results
