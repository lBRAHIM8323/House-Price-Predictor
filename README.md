## Project Overview

Predicting house prices is a common problem in the real estate industry. This repository aims to provide a solution specifically for predicting house prices in Delhi, India. By leveraging machine learning techniques, I have developed a model that can estimate the prices of houses based on various factors such, size, number of rooms, number of balconies, number of baths and other relevant features.

The prediction model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical house prices and corresponding features in Delhi.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the prediction model was downloaded by kaggle via the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namantrisoliya/magicbricks-new-delhi-flat-prices.
