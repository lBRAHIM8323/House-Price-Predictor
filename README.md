## Project Overview

Predicting house prices is a common problem in the real estate industry. This repository aims to provide a solution specifically for predicting house prices in Delhi, India. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed a model that can estimate the prices of houses based on various factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant features.

The prediction model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical house prices and corresponding features in Delhi.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the prediction model is not included in this repository. However, you can find a similar dataset on various real estate websites or public datasets related to Delhi's housing market. The dataset should ideally contain the following features:

- **Price**: The target variable representing the price of the house.
- **Location**: The location of the house in Delhi.
- **Size**: The size of the house in terms of area (in square feet or square meters).
- **Rooms**: The number of rooms in the house.
- **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Balcony**: The number of balconies in the house.
- **Other features**: Additional relevant features such as amenities, parking, etc.

Ensure that the dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel) and is preprocessed (cleaned and normalized) before training the model.

## Setup

To set up the project and run the prediction model locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
